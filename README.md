### Project Description:
There is an abundance of free resources on YouTube for learning. Some people may not be aware of this and fail to take full advantage of all the resources offered to them. With YouTube offering an abundance of content, it can be overwhelming to keep track of progress after watching many videos. Our solution is to provide a website that condenses important Youtube videos related to course content for students to use as a learning tool. The website will help narrow down the contents by providing only educational videos, so it will be easier for the students to search for the video that they need. It will also provide a tool for users to track their learning processes as they complete the videos.
