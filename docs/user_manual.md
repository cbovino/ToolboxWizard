# 377 project user manual
Youtube offers a tremendous amount of free knowledge, but one needs to know where to look and needs to vet through the millions of available videos. Toolbox Wizard is a web application that condenses important Youtube videos related to course content for students to use as a learning tool.

### The application has the following features:
1. Sign up features
   - The user will need to enter in their desired username, email, and password to create their account. This account will keep track of user progress and offer them a way to understand their journey of learning.

2. Completion feature
   - Once the user has watched a video for a particular subject, they can choose the video from a drop down menu related to the subject, and click Submit to notify the application that they have completed watching the video.

3. Progress feature
   - A progress table will show whether the videos on the site have an incomplete or complete status. At the moment, the video IDs (oneone) are shown. The first "one" corresponds to the subject number which is shown on the Videos page. The second "one" corresponds to where the video is placed within the subject section. “Oneone” means the first video (far left) in the Business section.

### How the user navigates through the application:
1. Input the VCL URL provided in this document into the URL bar in your browser. (If you are Professor Donal, you can navigate to the VCL account for “ctang123”).
2. You may be presented with a folder called “377project-master.” Click on it and then you may see a folder called “public_html.” Click on that.
3. A list of folders may be presented. Click on the folder called “login.” It’s within the “public_html” folder you clicked on in Step 2.
4. A login and sign-up page will open. If this is your first time accessing the web application, you will need to fill out the information boxes under “Sign Up.”
5. Enter in your desired Username, Email, and Password. Click Submit. If the Username is already taken, an error message will occur. You will then be redirected to the same page so you can log in. Log in with the credentials you just made.
6. Once you’re logged in, you will be directed to the web application’s home page. You should see Toolbox Wizard on the upper left and a banner saying “Learn Everyday.”
7. You may begin navigating the site by clicking on the thumbnail images of the subject you’re interested in. You can also access the same subjects by going to “Subjects” in the navigation bar on the top of the website. A drop down will open where you can see the different subjects.
8. For any subject you click on, you will be directed to site’s overall Video page, and into the subject that you clicked on. For example, if you clicked on the “Adobe” thumbnail on the home page, you will be redirected to the Adobe section on the video page.
9. Moving from left to right, the videos are given number IDs (one to three). If you finish watching video one for Adobe (left most video), open the drop down menu and choose Video One, and click Submit. A notification will pop up letting you know the Completion has been added to your account. The page will refresh.
10. You can check your completion status on each video by clicking on the “See Video Status” button at the top of the Video page, on the far right.
11. To Sign Out, click the Sign Out button on the navigation bar, at the top of any page. You will be redirected to the login and signup page.
